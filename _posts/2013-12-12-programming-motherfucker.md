When I was 18, still living at my parents house, a good friend of mine and me volunteered for Europe's biggest internet radio [#Musik](http://www.rautemusik.fm/) to rewrite their website. I was still a trainee at my current company and had a normal 8 hours working day. But right after being done with that, and I arrived at home I started hacking on the website. It was a hilarious time, but I learned a lot and we had so much fun! We also did a lot of mistakes, like writing our own framework and implementing every shitty component on our own. And even if PHP 5.3 was there at the time, we gave a fuck about name spacing our code and such.
Our final exam came. And right before, we launched the site. But when we were done, our ways divided and I became a Lead Developer at the company we were working at and got way to less time to hack on things I enjoy. I had way to much managing tasks back then. I just lived my programmers live, had some good and some bad times. Including [awesome](http://jsconf.eu/) [inspiring](http://2012.funconf.com/) [conferences](http://www.developer-conference.eu/), some cool projects and a shitload of new things I have learned.

At mid 2012 I had my very first public speaking gig at the [phpunconference](http://www.php-unconference.de/) here in Hamburg. And it was that much fun for me that I decided to do this more often, so I submitted my talk here and there. Ending up with my first international speaking gig at [TakeOff Conference 2013](http://takeoffconf.com/2013), I went there with 2 friends of mine. And we had a awesome time in north France, the Take Off Conf organizes did that conference for the very firs time. And they did an awesome job, but still there were just a few little things which annoyed us, that is why we were always like:

> If we were running a conference we would do it different

This is what happened eight month later. We spun up our very first conference, [So Coded 2013](http://socoded.com/) was a thing! Organizing this was a roller coaster ride, and right in the end sprint of organizing the event, my two friends guys got unemployed for (conference) unrelated reasons. So our default chit-chat topic was about what kind of business we could create. What could we do for a living? What would be fun?

In the middle of the discussion there was the idea in my head, a thing which bothers me for quite a long time. The year before I started becoming a conference speaker because I enjoy teaching and spreading the things I’ve learned so far. And on [every conference I spoke](/speaking.html) I want to upload my slides and give that link to the audience. So they can check all the stuff I mentioned later on. But for me as a speaker uploading slides on a shitty conference wifi was always a hazel. The platforms around really bugged me, some were not free and didn’t followed the FLOSS principles others had just a bad UX. And viewing the slides on your tablet or mobile wasn’t possible at all (from a point of UX and because of iframes and stuff). And remember how often you are checking stuff on your phone or table on a conference. So I came up with the idea to create a slide hosting platform that does **not** suck, that was the moment where the idea for [slidr.io](http://slidr.io/) was born. I just want to get rid of that pain I experienced so often.

Right in that Cafe we were sitting in I registered the domain (on my phone thanks to [DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com/)) and due to that fact that 2013 was the year I finally want to dig deeper into ruby I decided to use Rails as a framework. I had the complete software stack in mind, it didn’t cost me any effort to think what I would need, I just knew what I want to build. So right when I went home I started hacking away. I hacked the whole night till the early morning hours, no matter if I had to go to work next morning again. I read a lot of documentation and played around with rails, search for a plugin for handling auth and figured out how to run a rails app on Heroku. I had a very very basic setup running at just that night. This moment is now about 50 days and 80 commits ago. And since that day I finally rediscovered my hacking spirit. I just want to get things done, I want to see progress on that tool I want to build. That tool I want to change the industry with.

As I mentioned I were at so many conferences and I saw so many fellow nerds hacking (not surfing Facebook) at every free minute they had. I was kind of jealous, because I knew that feeling but it was kinda lost for me for a very long time. But now I’m also one of these, grabbing my laptop in every free minute to improve what I’ve build so far. I hack when I wait at the airport for my next flight. I hack at night, and meeting friends in a cafe, just to hack together.
I asked a bad ass UX expert and friend of mine (Fabian) for help, and lucky me, he also really liked that idea and the challenge of creating some thing new on a green field. So as of now we are a team of two passionate developers / designers getting our own playground for new technologies we always wanted to play around with. And we don't just make a demo for the purpose of testing things, we are building a real app.


In the past few days, I’ve been thinking about what happened over the last few months, and I realized that I whenever I share that story I inspire people. That's also why I am sharing the story here. Sometimes I’m afraid that I’ll lose this feeling again, and I don’t want it to take me another 3 years to rediscover it. 

So that I don’t forget that, I cobbled together this logo

![Programming Motherfucker](/assets/uploads/2013/logo_small.png)

I decided to use the term made popular by [Zed A. Shaw](http://zedshaw.com/): ["Programming Motherfucker”](http://programming-motherfucker.com/). It has a different meaning for me than being against all the Agile stuff which is happening in our community.

It’s more about doing what you love, focusing on why you started doing this kind of job, remembering the reason why I work in this industry. It's about programming, having fun making things, and creating software and *maybe* changing the world!

I want to make stickers out of it. Use it as a wallpaper and place it everywhere in my live. Just not to forget what I am really passionate about.

**Programming Motherfucker!**
