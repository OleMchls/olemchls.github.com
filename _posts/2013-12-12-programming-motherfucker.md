When I was 18, still iving at my parents house, a good friend of mine and me volunteered for europes biggest internet radio #musik to rewrite their website. I was still a trainee at my current company and had a normal 8h working day. But right after beeing done with that I came home and started hacling on the website. it was a hilarious time, but I leared a lot and we had so much fun! Our final exam came and right before we launched the site. but when we were done our ways diveded and I became a Lead Developer and got way to less time to hack on things I enjoyed. I lived my programmers live, had some good and some bad times.
When approximatly 3 years later two friends and me had the idea of running a conference. it was  a rollercoaster ride, and right in the end sprint of organizing the event, the other two guys got unemployed for unrelated reasons. So opur default chitty chat topic was about what kind of buisiness we could create what could we do. What would be fun?

In the middle of the discussion there was the idea in my mind, a thing which bothers me for quite  a long time. The year before I become a conference speaker because I enjoy teaching and spreading the things I’ve learend so far. And on every conference I spoke I want to upload my slides and give that link to my audience. So they can check all the stuff I mentioned in my talk later on. but for me as a speker uploading slides on a shitty conference wifi was always a hazzle. The platform which were around really bugs me, some were not free and didn’t dollowed the FLOSS priciples others had just a bad UX. And viwing the slides on your tablet or mobile wasn’t possible at all (from a point of UX). So I came up with the idea to create a slide hosting plattform that does not suck, that was the moment where slidr.io was born. I just want to get rid of that pain I expirienced so often.

Right in that Cafe we were sitting in I registered the domain (on my phone thatnks to DNSimple) and due to that fact that 2013 was the year I finally want to dig deeper in ruby I decided to build it in Rails. I had the complete software stack in mind, it didn’t cost me any effort, I just knew what I want to build. So right when I went home I started hacking away. I read a lot of docs and played around with rails, search for a plugin for handling auth and how to run a rails app on heroku. I had a very very basix setup running at just that day. This moment is now about 50 days ago. And since that day I finally rediscovered my hacking spirit. I just want tol get things done, I want to see progress on that tool I want to build. That tool I want to change the indusry with.

As i mentioned I were at so many conferences and I saw so many fellow nerds hacking at (not surfing facebook) at every free minute they had. I was kind of jealous, because I knew that feeling but it was kinda lost for me for a very long time. But now I’m also one of these, grabbing my laptop in every free minute to improve what I’ve build so far. I asked a bad ass UX expert and friend of mine (fabian) for help, and luckie me, he also really liked that idea. So as of now we are a team of two passionate developers getting our playground for new technologies we always wanted to play around with. And we dont just make a demo for the purpose of testing things, we are builing a real app.
