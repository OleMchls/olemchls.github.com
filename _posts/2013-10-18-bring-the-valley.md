> I will make the valley know, that Hamburg is way more awesome then Berlin!

This is a quote from [So Coded Conference](http://socoded.com/) after party. And this is, for me, one of the biggest compliments we as the organizers could get. Many people asked me: «Why do you do this?» Well. that's an obvious question, right? And with this blogpost I will try to explain why, especially in relation to the quote above.

I love the valley, exactly I love the hacker spirit around there. So many cool tech companies want to change the world we all live in. Every café you enter, you will find nerds sitting in front of their MacBooks, hacking on new things. So what's cool about this? These people don't do it for the money or the fame they might get. They do it because they believe! They believe in the things they build, they believe they can change some thing. It's the hacker spirit I love, tech people like we are creating this. So when I came back to Hamburg and took again a closer look to the few startups around. I quickly realized that these startups are different, different in a bad way. Almost all of them are founded by business people just trying to create the next Facebook and earn a shitload of money. Or even just to create a cheap shitty copy of Y to get any money. This fact really, really bugs me. So what to do?

One possible option is to just move to the valley. I guess almost everyone of us had, at some point, thought about this. And never say never but for the moment Hamburg also has some upsides for me. My wonderful girlfriend, my family and the wonderful city itself. So there must be another option, I said to myself.

> If I can't go to the valley. The valley has to come to me!

So pushing the tech community in my hometown was one of my personal goals I wanted to archive with the So Coded. Running a conference is obviously only one aspect of it. It's more about enabling people. To give them permissions, the permission to build awesome things, the permission to change the world and just the permission be awesome, as [Adam Brault](https://twitter.com/adambrault) stated on the JSConf.eu closing keynote this year. *Thanks buddy, this keynote was very inspiring to me*

So what's the point than? Well I need your help! This isn't my mission, it's ours! Running events like user groups or give them a place to happen if your office allow so, organize free programming lessons for interested people. So many great examples are around already so many organizations exists to support you if you want to do so! So many companies are willed to help! And at this point I want to say thank you to all the people and companies doing so. And of cause this does not exclusively apply to Hamburg, if you feel your cities tech community should improve, change it!

So coming back to the initial quote, X is way more awesome then Y? That's not the point I wanted to make, it's just that I was overwhelmed by the feedback we got in general and that this really empowered my to continue my mission.

Closing this, I wanted to say thank you to all the people inspiring me to do so!
