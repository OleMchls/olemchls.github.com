Hey there,

Today I have to create some UML Class Diagrams for my programming class, but as I mentioned before, I’m lazy, so I want to create the diagram from the source files, and I knew there was a way in NetBeans to do so. But they removed this Feature (package) by default. I don’t know why, because this is an amazing feature here’s a screen.

If you also want to use this feature I will give you an easy 4-step-manual:

1.  Go to the [Netbeans Module Cluster download page][2]
2.  Download the ‘*netbeans-6.9.1-201007282301-ml-uml.zip*‘ file (the version number should or could higher or lower, depending on your installed version)
3.  Unpack the ‘UML’-folder in your NetBeans directory
4.  Restart NetBeans

That’s it, easy, heh?

Have fun by trying it on your own! Leave a comment if there was any questions left or to made my day ;)
