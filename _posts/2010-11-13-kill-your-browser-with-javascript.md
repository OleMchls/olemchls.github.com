Hey There, it’s me again,

On monday I will talk about Chrome as a Developer Browser, and during the preparation of this presentation I wrote this little JavaScript Object that kill your Browser, if you want to see more, be prepared for my presentation on Monday at InnoGames, and if you can’t come, due to missing access rights to our office. Be prepared for the slides here on my Blog.

```javascript
var KillBrowser = {
i : 0,
withAlert : function(){
while(true){
this.i ;
alert(this.i)
}
},
withWhileLoop : function(){
while(true){}
},
withMathPow : function(){
while(true){
this.i ;
this.i =Math.pow(this.i,2)
}
}
}
```

And you can try this script right here in my Blog. But …
 ATTENTION! THIS WILL KILL YOUR BROWSER OR YOUR TAB!
