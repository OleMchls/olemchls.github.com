Hi @all,

During the last Month I spend a lot of my time with JavaScript developing, And I found some very very cool slides from [ed-finkler][1] during all my researches. And I want to share it with you. There in there, there were a few very cool JS examples, and many Answers to Questions PHP-Developers often had during JS-Development.
