Hey there,

Due to my post to the [Cowork of Fancybox and Cloud-zoom][1], I regognize that many people came here with a site translator like bablefish and google translate. That gives me a kick in my ass to realize that I can’t go on with bloggin in German.

So all further blog posts will be in English. And I translated the Fancybox/Cloud-zoom post into english.

Hope that this will help you all (and forsure my blog)! ![:)][2]
