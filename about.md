After my traineeship at [InnoGames](http://www.innogames.de) I continued working there as a lead developer for their biggest big social game WestWars. Next station [Digital Pioneers N.V.](http://www.digitalpioneers.de) where I’ve done a lot of high tech protoyping and DevOps working with various new tech stuff. After I left DP, I joined [Jimdo](http://www.jimdo.com), here I try to bring in my knowledge in software quality, architecture and the cloud.

I really love all the new technologies from NoSQL and node.js to Metrics Driven Development and bringing cool tools and tech to my developer colleagues. And I really really enjoy speaking at conferences and user groups, like I did on [CodeMash 2015](http://www.codemash.org/) or [FOSDEM 2013](https://fosdem.org).

If you find an old german post, it is because I started this Blog in German, but after my first more or less successfull post I realized that more and more people came here with a page translater, so I decided to continue in English.

This is what you will find on all the conference websites

> Ole Michaelis is the co-founder of SoCoded, a hackfest and web development conference in Hamburg. He’s a Software Engineer at Jimdo, a DIY website creator, where he focuses on backend development. In his free time, he’s building slidr.io, a hazzle-free slide sharing platform. Ole is passionate about open source software, enjoys traveling, and loves Mexican food. He classifies himself as a 'bad' German as he dislikes beer and soccer – the traditional German past-times.
