Hey stranger, welcome to my blog.

I’m a Software Developer working at [Digital Pioneers N.V.][2] We’re rapidly prototypig new Ideas with awesome new bleeding edge techniques, like Symfony2, Node.js and all the other cool, new shiny stuff! Before I started there I worked for [InnoGames][3] from 2009 to 2012, I worked on Tribal Wars and Westwars, the first Social Game of InnoGames. After I finished my trainee ship at InnoGames on 2011 I continue as a Lead Software Developer.

I started this Blog in German, but after my first more or less successfull post I realized that more and more people came here with a page translater, so I decided to continue in English.

I try only to write about interessting technical and software development topics.

Hopy you enjoy it, if you like it follow me on Twitter or share the post via Facebook.
