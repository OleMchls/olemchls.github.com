I love spreading the word for things I really love and people always say my enthusiasm is contagious. Everytime I do a talk at a conference or user group, people catch me up afterwards and tell me that I made them think or curious about something. And that's why I love doing this! <small>oh, and I just love being in the limelight</small>

> I would love to come to your conference!

Here's a short list of conferences or user groups I spoke at.
